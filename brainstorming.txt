things make with a $ means that they have been finished

how to get the game to run
so it looks like I will have to make the whole game in c++
that includes renderin the actually board in c++
    -Need to find a graphics package in c++
    -make the board on there 
After the graphics are made for the board:
    -I thinking right now that I should try to make the digital board use the backend that I created
    -each digital square is assigned corresponsing coordinates on the Board object and the corresponsing piece object
        - this will make it so when a move is made the player clicks and drags a piece the move is then checked on the 
         backend board then the postions are updated on the visual board
         **there honestly might be no reason to have the backedn board, but if thats the case I will delete it later
    -what I need to do now:
        -find a grahpics package
        -make a class for the board graphics??
            -or should I just jave the graphics in the board class 
                **this might make more sense and make my life easier
        -make a class to actually run the game and set up the players




Future ideas:
    -I really want to figure out how to make the game accesible on a website
    -multiplayer!?!
    -make a AI for a person to play against 
    -make funny gamemodes
