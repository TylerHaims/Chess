Current:
working on the board 
have to make the board and have to make a test to make sure that all of the
pieces of the board are in the right spot

Finsihed working on the board now trying to make the game work
**look at the brainstorming file

commands for running gtest

**you can put these in a make file for your nxt set of tests
g++ (programs that you're compiling) -lgtest(links the gtest library) -lgtest_main(creates a main function to run tests) 
-pthread(*need to look up more about this)

pthread
-what I think it does:
helps with multithreaded applications and google test uses multithreading internally
-More on what it actually does:
???



learning makefile stuff:

 %.o: %.cpp
	g++ -c $< -o $@

this is a cool line of code that I found for a make file that converts all .cpp files into .o files
it gives the instructions on how to build any .o file from a .cpp file
$< is the input (.cpp)
$@ is the output (.o)


make file format
(target): prerequisit
kinda failed at this gonna try again tmrw



how I have the board and piece memory set up:
I have the piece class allocate memory onto the heap
the board function makes new instances of the piece class
the board it's self is on the stack (this can be changes with the new keyword)
